# AeroQatar

## A 3D Game Simulation of a Qatar Airliner in Unity3D.

### A `POC` game for `Qatar Airways` made using Unity's Physics Engine and Cross Platform Input Module.

#### The simulation allows you to fly around the world with navigation tools:
- The `Compass` on the top left help you to guide through the world direction.
- The `Level Guide` on the top right help you to check and maintain the plane level while flying.
- The `Elevation Level` guide below the **Level Guide** will help you to check and maintain the dip angle of the plane.

#### The simulation gives you various controls to fly the plain around:
- The Lever on the Left is the `Throttle` for the plane.
- The 2 Levers in the `Middle` controls the elevation and altitude.
  - The lever on the **Left** controls the **Altitude** and will give or take the lift from the plane.
  - The lever on the **Right** controls the **Elevation** and will change the dip angle while flying.
   
   `Note: The plane should be atleast having the speed of `**100Km/h** `for the Middle Controls to work.`
- The 2 Gauges in right bottom is for the `Speed` and `Altitude.`

**PS:** If anything goes wrong, you can always apply the `Breaks`. :wink:
